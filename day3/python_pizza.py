Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza! Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program.

Based on a user's order, work out their final bill. Use the input() function to get a user's preferences and then add up the total for their order and tell them how much they have to pay.

Small pizza (S): $15

Medium pizza (M): $20

Large pizza (L): $25

Add pepperoni for small pizza (Y or N): +$2

Add pepperoni for medium or large pizza (Y or N): +$3

Add extra cheese for any size pizza (Y or N): +$1

Example Interaction
Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!
What size pizza do you want? S, M or L: L
Do you want pepperoni on your pizza? Y or N: Y
Do you want extra cheese? Y or N: N
Your final bill is: $28.
